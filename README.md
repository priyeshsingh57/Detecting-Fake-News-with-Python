# Detecting-Fake-News-with-Python
This Python Project Classifies the News Data into REAL and FAKE. Using sklearn, a TfidfVectorizer is built on our dataset. Then, a PassiveAggressive Classifier is fit to the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tells how good the model is.
